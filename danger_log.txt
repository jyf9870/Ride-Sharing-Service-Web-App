Danger Log

1. One danger in our application is that user passwords are stored in plain text 
in the database. While this is easy for testing and debugging internally, it is
very dangerious and is a security risk. We could have implemented some hashing
with salt or used some Django built-in authentication. But we have decided to 
write everything on our own because it is the first time we are building a web
application using Django. So it is important for us to keep this in the danger
log.

2. Another danger within the authentication component is that we used a
traditional way of implementing a session identifier. When a user is logged in,
a session is created. However, as we learned in class, the more modern approach
is to store a JSON Web Token (JWT) in a cookie or LocalStorage. Server can 
provide a bit of JSON that is cryptographically signed by the server, which
cannot be tampered with. Also, some login information can be held in there as
well. It could be a more secure method for authentication.
